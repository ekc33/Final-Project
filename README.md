## Abstract
We have looked through many different graphs regarding Crime, Housing, Nature, and Livability. Some of the notable neighborhoods so far the we have seen are Squirrel Hill,
St. Clair, East Liberty, and Chataeu have some strong data going for it, but that is only after our initial research. After putting our research together we found that  
Squirrel Hill can be considered the best as the life expectancy is very high and crime was low. The price of housing is quite high though.
